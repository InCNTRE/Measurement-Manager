ABOUT
These Perl modules build Flowvisor datastructures that contain
references to slice and device objects. These are then used, to
generate a Nagios configuration file. The driver script (go.pl) can be
edited to enable you to import this Flowvisor information for other
applications, and the Fvctl moldule can be extended for other XMLRPC
calls to Flowvisor.

Note: The latest version of Flowvisor contains the utility ( fvcli ) 
that allows users to remotely query the Flowvisor and can be extended
to achieve similar functionality.

INSTRUCTIONS
1) You may need to install the Frontier::Client Perl module
	For Debian/Ubuntu:
		apt-get install libfrontier-rpc-perl

2) Specify the URL(s) of the Flowvisor(s) that you have access to in go.pl
	Ex. "https://[username]:[password]\@[hostname]:8080/xmlrpc"
	Note: We placed the credentials in Auth.pm
	
3) To run the script to generate Nagios configuration files, run:
	perl go.pl

   Which will generate:
   	auto-openflow.cfg

4) This script can then be imported into Nagios ( http://www.nagios.org/ )

   This script needs to be placed in:
   	/usr/local/nagios/etc/

   The file /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg will need to be edited to 
   contain the following line:
	cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/auto-openflow.cfg   

   To check the sanity of the new configuration file, run:
        sudo /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

   If the config is sane, you can reload Nagios with your new configurations
        sudo /etc/init.d/nagios restart

COMMON ERRORS
1) "No method: Flowvisor::set_username at go.pl line 54"
	Be sure to specify the proper credentials in Auth.pm or go.pl
